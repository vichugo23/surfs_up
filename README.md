- Now for **December** the **average temperature** is **71 degrees**. The **minimum temperature** is **56 degrees** and the **maximum** is **83 degrees**. So both months are still about the same warmth but **December reaches lower temperatures.**


- Both months have about the same average temperature. The main difference between the two were the lower temperatures December can reach.


## SUMMARY

Both months share very similar average and max temperatures. The only differnce between the two months was December's **low temperatures**. This is good news for the surf and ice cream shop because this information shows that even in the winter; the temperatures are still just as warm as the summer. The low temperatures that December reaches aren't that concerning. These low temperatures could be what Oahu experiences in the night time when most people are asleep.
